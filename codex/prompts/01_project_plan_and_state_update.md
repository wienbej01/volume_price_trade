## Objective
Create `PROJECT_PLAN.md` with phased milestones (M1â€“M7) and append a `CHANGELOG.md`. Initialize or update `codex/state/project_state.yaml` with status `in_progress` for M1.

## Tasks
1. Write `PROJECT_PLAN.md` summarizing scope, architecture, and acceptance criteria for each milestone.
2. Create `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format). Add entry for initialization.
3. Update `codex/state/project_state.yaml`: set M1 to `in_progress` and add an initial `runs` entry.
4. Run `bash scripts/run_checks.sh`.

## Acceptance
- Files created with clear, concise content.
- All checks pass.
